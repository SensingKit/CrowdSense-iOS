# CrowdSense-iOS

CrowdSense is a free continuous sensing tool, based on the open source library [SensingKit](http://www.sensingkit.org). It provides an easy way for researchers to capture sensor data using any iOS device. Taking user privacy seriously, all data are fully anonymised. You can access all sensed data in the iOS device using iTunes file sharing.

It is available for free on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/crowdsense/id930853606?ls=1&mt=8).
