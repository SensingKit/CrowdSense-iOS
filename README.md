# CrowdSense-iOS

CrowdSense is a free continuous sensing tool, based on the open-source SensingKit framework, that allows researchers to harness the full potential of mobile sensor data collection via iOS devices. The app requires explicit permission from users before activating any sensors, ensuring that all data collection is transparent and secure. Data recorded with CrowdSense can be conveniently shared within the app or exported securely via USB using iTunes File Sharing, giving researchers flexible options for data analysis.

It is available for free on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/crowdsense/id930853606?ls=1&mt=8).
